# Robotic Process Automation

## Overview

The project was to create a program which can automate the testing of a web application (which happened to be my CS50 final project) At the same time it provided excellent insight into GUI automation and key libraries such as pyautogui, selenium and chromedriver. This is highly transferable as taking information and filling in a web based form is a common task.

## Tools and libraries used

* PyAutoGUI
* Selenium
* OS
* Random
* Web-browser
* VS Code

## Folder contents

* auto-web-tester.py
* text files for input values
* unit tests


## Skills applied

* Automating processes with python
* Using GUI automation for controlling mouse and keyboard
* Using selenium to test websites by using HTML targets


## Challenges

* Ensuring libraries and file paths are properly installed and referenced
* Understanding wait times to ensure bot does not outpace server
* Providing useful updates to the user via command line during runtime
